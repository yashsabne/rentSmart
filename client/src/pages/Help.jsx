    <h3>Project Title: RentSmart - A Rental Management System</h3>
    
    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p>RentSmart is an innovative rental management platform that aims to provide a seamless experience for both property owners and tenants. The platform connects property owners with prospective renters, streamlining the rental process through an easy-to-use, efficient system. With features for property listing, tenant management, lease tracking, payment processing, and more, RentSmart aims to become the go-to solution for property rentals.</p>
    
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of the RentSmart project is to create a platform that simplifies the rental process for both landlords and tenants.

The platform also supports advanced features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure user authentication (via email or Google login).</li>
        <li>Real-time chat for communication between tenants and landlords.</li>
        <li>Integration with payment systems for rent payments.</li>
        <li>Property search and advanced filtering options.</li>
        <li>Dashboard to manage personal details, property listings, and saved properties.</li>
    </ul>
